# TrackForMe

TrackForMe is a user-friendly, location-based tracking application designed to enhance personal safety and convenience. The application offers two main features:

1. Geographical area tracking, which sends notifications to users when they enter or exit a designated area.
2. Bluetooth bracelet connection, which sends notifications to users when the bracelet and the device lose connection, such as when a child wearing the bracelet wanders off from their guardian.
